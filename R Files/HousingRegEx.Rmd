## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r}
FM_Housing_Raw <- read_csv(unz("../Data/FM_Housing_Raw.zip", "FM_Housing_Raw.csv"), col_types = cols(
  `Lease Term` = col_character(),
  `Directions` = col_character(),
  `Water Frontage Length` = col_integer()
))
```

```{r}
FM_Housing_Clean <- FM_Housing_Raw %>% select(-c("Property Type", "Card Format")) #All properties are Residential for both Property Type and Card Format variables
FM_Housing_Clean <- FM_Housing_Clean %>% select(-c("List Number", "Directions")) #Arbitrary values not useful for data mining
FM_Housing_Clean$`Year Built`[FM_Housing_Clean$`Year Built` < 1600 | FM_Housing_Clean$`Year Built` > 2021] <- NA
FM_Housing_Clean <- FM_Housing_Clean %>% mutate("List Price Change":=`List Price`-`Original List Price`)
FM_Housing_Clean <- FM_Housing_Clean %>% mutate("Sold/List Price Difference":=`Sold Price` - `List Price`)
FM_Housing_Clean <- FM_Housing_Clean %>% mutate("Sold/Original List Price Difference":=`Sold Price` - `Original List Price`)

```



```{r}
