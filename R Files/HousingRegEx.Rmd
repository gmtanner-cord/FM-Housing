## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r}
FM_Housing_Raw <- read_csv(unz("../Data/FM_Housing_Raw.zip", "FM_Housing_Raw.csv"), col_types = cols(
  `Lease Term` = col_character(),
  `Directions` = col_character(),
  `Water Frontage Length` = col_integer()
))
```

```{r}
FM_Housing_Clean <- FM_Housing_Raw %>% select(-c("Property Type", "Card Format")) #All properties are Residential for both Property Type and Card Format variables
FM_Housing_Clean <- FM_Housing_Clean %>% select(-c("List Number", "Directions")) #Arbitrary values not useful for data mining
FM_Housing_Clean$`Year Built`[FM_Housing_Clean$`Year Built` < 1600 | FM_Housing_Clean$`Year Built` > 2021] <- NA
FM_Housing_Clean <- FM_Housing_Clean %>% mutate("List Price Change":=`List Price`-`Original List Price`)
FM_Housing_Clean <- FM_Housing_Clean %>% mutate("Sold/List Price Difference":=`Sold Price` - `List Price`)
FM_Housing_Clean <- FM_Housing_Clean %>% mutate("Sold/Original List Price Difference":=`Sold Price` - `Original List Price`)

```



```{r}
features <- FM_Housing_Raw %>% select(`Features`)


features

```
Note that if you want to catch comma, space, word, period, space, then you could modify the capture group to (, .+\\. ). You only need to match one period, not one or more.


```{r}
#(features <- gsub(".+(, .+\\.+ ).+", "\\1", ds$name, perl = TRUE))

#grep(`Air Conditioning|Central|Yes;`, features, ignore.case = TRUE)

featuresfilter <- features %>% head(10)
featuresfilter

```
```{r}
# if Air Conditioning matches, extract by look behind Air Conditioning for next word, otherwise write 'no' if false

featuresfilter %>% mutate(AC=ifelse(str_detect(`Features`,"Air Conditioning"), str_extract(`Features`,"(?<=Air Conditioning\\|)\\w+"), "NO"))%>% mutate(Exterior_Siding=ifelse(str_detect(`Features`,"Vinyl Siding|Metal Siding|Brick|Wood Siding|Shingle/Shake|Stucco"), str_extract(`Features`,"(Metal Siding)|(Vinyl Siding)|(Brick)|(Wood Siding)|(Shingle/Shake)|(Stucco)"), "NO")) %>%
